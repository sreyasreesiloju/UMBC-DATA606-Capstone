## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Merging Datasets** : To consolidate data for analysis, utilized the concat function from the pandas library to merge four distinct datasets. This operation resulted in a unified dataset containing 11,003 rows and 2 columns. Each row represents a unique resume, and each resume is categorized according to its specific category. This structured format facilitates further analysis, allowing to explore the relationships and distributions of resumes across different categories effectively.
2. **Checking for NUll/Missing values** : The integrity of the dataset is crucial for accurate analysis. Conducted a thorough examination for any NULL or missing values using the *isna()* function. The outcome of this analysis revealed that there are no missing values within the dataset. Consequently, proceeded with the analysis without the need to address any missing data, ensuring that findings are based on a complete dataset.
3. **Handling Duplicate Values** : To ensure the model is trained on the unique values, the data given to it should be distinct without consisting of rendundant rows. The number of duplicated rows present in the dataset is given by *duplicated* function. The duplicates are dropped from the dataset using *.drop_duplicates()* function of dataframe.
4. **Identifying the unique categories**: Standardizes various representations of the same category by mapping them to a consistent label, such as consolidating *Python_Developer* and *Python Developer* into *Python Developer* and same with the *Java_Developer* and remaining categories. This enhances clarity, facilitates analysis, and reduces redundancy in the dataset, making it easier to work with and maintain as new variations are identified.
5. **Statistics of Dataset** : To gain insights into the dataset’s composition, employed the *describe(include='all')* function. This summary statistic provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including:
    1. Count: The total number of records, which is 11,003.
    2. Unique Values: The total number of distinct categories present in the dataset, totaling 62 unique categories.
    3. Most Frequent Data: The function also identifies the most frequently occurring data points, presenting their respective frequencies. This information is invaluable as it highlights the dominant categories and resume types, guiding focus for further exploration and analysis.
6. **Distribution of Categories**: Analyzing the distribution of the categories is essential to understand how the resumes are spread across different categories. Dataset includes 65 unique categories, and the distribution is not uniform. Some categories may contain a significantly higher number of resumes compared to others, indicating possible trends or preferences in resume submissions. Utilized *Plotly Express* to visually represent this distribution, creating interactive plots that illustrate the frequency of resumes within each category. This visual exploration aids in identifying categories that may require deeper analysis or consideration for future projects.

  3. The X_test consists of 2201 rows and 85373 columns.
  4. The y_test consists of 2201 rows.

 **Models used for training**
 1. **Logistic Regression**: **Logistic Regression** model was implemented using the **OneVsRestClassifier** to handle multi-class classification, with a maximum iteration limit of **1,000** to ensure convergence. The model was trained on the training dataset *(X_train, y_train)* and used to predict categories for the testing dataset *X_test*. The accuracy of the predictions was evaluated using the **accuracy score** metric, achieved an accuracy of **0.82**, demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-class classification tasks and its balanced performance across different categories.
 2. **Support Vector Machine**: **Support Vector Machine** is a supervised learning model used for classification tasks, works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes. SVMs can utilize different kernel functions, such as **linear** and **radial basis function (RBF)**, to map data into higher-dimensional spaces for better classification.
    1. **Linear**: The SVM classifier was implemented using the *OneVsRestClassifier* wrapper with an SVM configured to use a *linear kernel*. This kernel is effective when the data is linearly separable, allowing the model to classify data by finding a straight decision boundary. The linear kernel excelled in cases where data was linearly separable, achieving an accuracy of **0.844**.
    2. **RBF**: The SVM classifier was implemented with an **RBF (Radial Basis Function)** kernel, which is well-suited for handling non-linear data. This kernel maps the data into a higher-dimensional space, enabling the separation of complex class boundaries. The RBF kernel handled non-linear patterns effectively, achieving an accuracy of **0.847**.
3. **Naive Bayes**: **Naive Bayes model** was implemented using the **MultinomialNB classifier** wrapped in a **OneVsRestClassifier** to handle multi-class classification tasks. This model is particularly suited for data represented by frequency counts or probabilities, as it assumes conditional independence between features given the class. The model's performance was evaluated using the accuracy score, achieving an accuracy of **0.567**.
4. **Random Forest Classifier**: **Random Forest model** was implemented using the **RandomForestClassifier** wrapped in a **OneVsRestClassifier** to handle multi-class classification tasks. Configured with 50 estimators and a fixed random state for reproducibility, the model leverages an ensemble of decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. The model's accuracy, evaluated using the accuracy score metric, was found to be **0.76**, demonstrating its robustness in handling large and complex datasets while maintaining generalization across different classes.
5. **Decision Tree Classifier**: **Decision Tree model** was implemented using the **DecisionTreeClassifier** wrapped in a **OneVsRestClassifier** for multi-class classification. Configured with a fixed random state for reproducibility, the model builds a tree structure to partition the data based on feature values, effectively learning class boundaries. The model's performance, evaluated using the accuracy score metric, achieved an accuracy of **0.71**, showcasing its ability to handle classification tasks with interpretable and straightforward decision-making processes.

**Metric Evaluation**

![Accuarcies obtained by machine learning models](accuracies.png)

After evaluating all the models, the **SVM** with the **RBF kernel** emerged as the best model with an accuracy of **0.847**. This model demonstrated exceptional performance by effectively capturing the complex relationships in the data, handling non-linear patterns, and providing accurate categorizations for resume classification. Given its superior accuracy and ability to deal with non-linear decision boundaries, the SVM with RBF kernel was chosen for the further categorization of resumes, ensuring high-quality predictions for job role classification.

**Ensuring that SVM RBF is the best model**
* **Confusion Matrix**
  
    * To evaluate the performance of the SVM model with a rbf kernel on the resume categorization task. After predicting the labels for the test dataset using the trained model, the confusion_matrix function from sklearn.metrics computes the matrix, which compares the true labels *y_test* with the predicted labels *ypred*. The matrix is annotated with the *job roles* on both the x and y axes, making it easy to identify which job roles were correctly or incorrectly predicted. The color scale, set to *Viridis*, helps highlight areas of the matrix with higher values, indicating where the model performed well or poorly. This visualization allows for a clear understanding of how well the model classified each job role and identifies areas for improvement in classification performance.
   
![confusion_matrix](confusion_matrix.png)
* **Scatter Plot**
  
   * Scatter plot to visually compare the true and predicted values for the SVC model with the RBF kernel on the resume categorization task. The scatter plot is then generated using Plotly's *px.scatter*, with the true values plotted on the x-axis and the predicted values on the y-axis. This visualizes how close the model's predictions are to the actual values. The red dashed line is added to the plot to represent the "perfect prediction line" (y = x), where the true values perfectly match the predicted values. This line serves as a reference to easily identify how well the model's predictions align with the true labels. Points that lie on or near the red line indicate accurate predictions, while points far from the line highlight misclassifications.
